# Luke JS Challenges #

For all of the Javascript challenges, MochaJS (https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) is used as the Unit Testing framework and is the only dependency.

For challenges 01 and 03, a `tests` folder has been included with the files used as the input and the expected output.

For the challenge 02, no files where used in the Unit Tests, just plain strings. Naturally, it is still possible to use files as the input with `run.js`. See the README.md in /02 for details.

Install dependencies

    $ npm install

    $ npm t

To run the main program, `cd` into this directory and type. 
    
    $ node run.js
    
Keep in mind that you will have to use STDIN to view the output. See below.

##### From input file  
To run the program with a local file as the input:

    $ node run.js < [filepath]

##### From command line input  
To get the output directly from a command line input without using a document/file, run the program, then paste the contents of the clipboard into the console or type it by hand. The ^D character at the bottom represent the End-of-Transmission signal.

```sh
    $ node run.js
    //;
    1,1
    1,
    1;1;1,1
    1,
    ^D
```
